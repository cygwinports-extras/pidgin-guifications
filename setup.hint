ldesc: "Guifications is a Pidgin plugin that displays 'toaster' popups 
in a user-defined corner of the screen, similar to features that have 
been added to the official MSN Messenger (now called Windows Live 
Messenger), Yahoo! Messenger and AOL Instant Messenger clients. It's 
highly configurable, easy to use, and has theme support. It really is 
the end-all, be-all toaster pop-up plugin for Pidgin!"
